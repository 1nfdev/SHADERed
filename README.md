SHADERed is a lightweight tool for creating and testing your HLSL and GLSL shaders. It is easy to use,
open source and frequently updated with new features. SHADERed is great for fast shader development.
Hit one key and see your new shader in action immediately. It currently only works on Windows.

Feel free to contact me if you want some missing feature to be implemented.

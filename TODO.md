- [ ] sampler states
- [ ] Geometry shader
- [ ] movable geometry (left click)
- [ ] options (code editor font, theme, etc...)
- [ ] keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] help -> settings | manual | about

QoL:
- [ ] recompile not working without saving changes
- [ ] clear message group after renaming pipeline item
- [ ] close code editor when shader is deleted/replaced/etc..
- [ ] ask the user if they are 100% sure they want to create new project/delete shader/close program/etc...
- [ ] shader variable pointers & copying
- [ ] move m_renderStats to StatsPage
- [ ] fix the app crash at start up when the program cant compile the shader + all other crashes
- [ ] having split view code editors messes up the focus
- [ ] automatically detect buffer index when adding variables on triple click on buffer index (using D3DReflect)
- [ ] do all TODOs (comments)
- [ ] open item properties on double click
- [ ] add Save Copy (copies all the shaders to the project directory)
- [ ] replace state string names with enums
- [ ] skin ImGui (add light theme + maybe redesing)
- [ ] save isFullscreen and isMaximized on exit/on size change
- [ ] implement Logger in MoonLight (so that we can redirect errors from console to our ErrorView) + hide win32 console
- [ ] change some constants (example: vertex shader path strcpy)
- [ ] CreateItemUI (ShaderPass) -> decompile shader and detect input layout (+ possibly detect variables - matVP == automatically add ViewProjection variable, matGeo == auto add GeoMatrix variable, etc...)
- [ ] PipelineUI.GetSelectedShaderPass() + add Geometry and other options under "Create" menu item in GUIManager
- [ ] GLSL to HLSL transcompiler
- [ ] "Save preview as image" option
- [ ] offer list of all groups instead of manually entering group name when creating mesh/model item
- [ ] more model file types
- [ ] add option to switch to FPS camera
- [ ] comment the code

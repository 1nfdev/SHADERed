- [ ] movable geometry (left click)
- [ ] options (code editor font, theme, etc...)
- [ ] keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] help -> settings | manual | about

QoL:

- [ ] ask the user if they are 100% sure they want to create new project/delete shader/etc...
- [ ] shader variable pointers & copying
- [ ] move m_renderStats to StatsPage
- [ ] fix the app crash at start up when the program cant compile the shader
- [ ] having split view code editors messes up the focus
- [ ] automatically detect buffer index when adding variables on triple click on buffer index (using D3DReflect)
- [ ] fix various mem leaks in PipelineManager::Item Data objects
- [ ] do all TODOs
- [ ] when Save As-ing export properties + save all project files (copy them)
- [ ] replace string names with enums
